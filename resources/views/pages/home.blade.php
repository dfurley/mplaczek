			<strong class="paper-title">We study how the hypothalamus of the brain is formed in the embryo.</strong> In development,
			hypothalamic nerves and glia are built in space and time with an order and precision that leads
			ultimately to the integrated assembly of the brain-body axis. The proper development of the
			hypothalamus is therefore vital to ensure that throughout life, brain and body function in
			perfect harmony and balance. Our research focuses on the stem and progenitor cells that
			build the hypothalamus. Our goal is to characterise the molecular networks involved in
			hypothalamic development, and determine how they work to build and maintain the different
			cells of the hypothalamus. Our work will contribute to understanding the importance of the
			hypothalamus to robust long-term health and will shed light onto diseases and disruptions of
			homeostasis.
